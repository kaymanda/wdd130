            <h4>Baked Goods Benefits</h4>
            <p>Homemade bread is something you think of when you think of your grandma, at least that is what I thought when I was younger. Why is that? I think with the convenience of stores and mass production of baked goods it has become the norm to just go to the store and buy bread and other baked goods. For me I remember every time I went to my grandparents home my grandma always had something homemade to eat and it was always the best thing I have eaten and even taught me how to make yummy baked goods, it is one of my favorite memories. I want to create a space where I can share what I have learned over the years and share as a mom why I switched for a lot of store-bought baked goods to learning and making them from home. I also would love to show you just how versatile bread dough and why more and more people are starting to bake more in their kitchen.</p>

            <p>I have beeen making bread for my family for the last six years. It started as a way to save money because my kids love toast and sandwiches. After I got the hang of making sandwich bread I expanded my knowledge and started making rolls and hamburger buns. In recent years I have made bread for gifts and to provide bread for the sacrament in my ward each week which is a blessing. I enjoy sharing my talents with others around me. I enjoy making sweets for my family instead of going an buying something from the store. I also love being able to save money. </p>
