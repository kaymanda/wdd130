    <h4>Why is Sacrament Attendance Important?</h4>
    <p> We were asked to speak today clear back in the beginning of August. So, I had quite a bit time to write my talk right, wrong. I was originally given the topic How service has blessed my life; it was a great topic so I started figuring out how to write it and what I would say. Well Friday morning I was in my Institute zoom class and was overwhelmed with the spirit that I needed to ask Brother Williams for a new topic, right after class I texted him and asked for a new topic, he asked me what topic I feel like I need to talk about and I responded not sure I just felt I needed a new topic, a little bit later I was given the topic, I may never know why I felt so overwhelmed to ask for a different topic and I hope this talk will go well and that you may feel of the Spirit today. My new topic is Why is sacrament attendance important? This talk will probably be all over the place and I pray that the Spirit will be with me. After given this topic I called my parents and asked them and the one thing my dad said really hit me, he said after 6 days of being in the world its nice come to sacrament to renew our covenants and feel the Spirit and helps you through the week to come. In October 2008 Elder Dallin H. Oaks gave a general conference talk on Sacrament Meeting and the Sacrament he said, “The ordinance of the sacrament makes the sacrament meeting the most sacred and important meeting in the Church. It is the only Sabbath meeting the entire family can attend together.” We are so blessed to be able to be able to come to church each Sunday spend time with our family, feel the spirit and the God’s love. I know there are members who would love to be here but are unable to do to physical or mental issues or homebound I know the Lord knows you and loves you and he understands.  
        When doing research, I came across an article from the Sept. 2001 Ensign by Elder Vaughn J. Featherstone in the article he said, “Throughout the Church each week, members gather for the opportunity to partake of the sacrament. This is a deep and meaningful privilege, an expression of God’s love for His children that provides a way whereby we can be cleansed of our sins. Among those who gather may be people who are suffering deeply, perhaps due to wayward children, financial stress, debilitating illness, death, depression, loneliness, despair, sin, or sorrow. It is important, therefore, that sacrament meetings accomplish their purpose. What we do in them may be more important to someone there than we would ever know. Sacrament meeting is often the primary means for rescuing the troubled soul.”
        In the August 2004 Ensign President Nelson who was part of the quorum of the twelve apostles said, “Each member of the Church bears responsibility for the spiritual enrichment that can come from a sacrament meeting. Each should sing with a grateful heart and respond with an audible “amen” at the conclusion of a prayer or a testimony. We personally ponder the Atonement of Jesus Christ. We reflect upon the significance of His suffering at Gethsemane and His Crucifixion on Calvary. At this time, each of us is to “examine himself” (1 Cor. 11:28) and reflect upon personal covenants made with the Lord. At this time, we meditate upon the sacred things of God.”
        To me sacrament attendance is important because I am reminded that God love me and all of us that he sent his Only Begotten Son who in turned atoned for us. In the gospel topics under Atonement of Jesus Christ it says, “As used in the scriptures, to atone is to suffer the penalty for sins, thereby removing the effects of sin from the repentant sinner and allowing him or her to be reconciled to God. Jesus Christ was the only one capable of carrying out the Atonement for all mankind. Because of His Atonement, all people will be resurrected, and those who obey His gospel will receive the gift of eternal life with God.”  It also says, “Although we are redeemed unconditionally from the universal effects of the Fall, we are accountable for our own sins. But we can be forgiven and cleansed from the stain of sin if we “apply the atoning blood of Christ” (Mosiah 4:2). We must exercise faith in Jesus Christ, repent, be baptized for the remission of sins, and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.”  We are able to take time to examine our lives and repent of sins. We do not need to be perfect in order to partake of the sacrament, but we should have a spirit of humility and repentance in their hearts. In 3 Nephi 9:20-22 it says, “20 And ye shall offer for a sacrifice unto me a broken heart and a contrite spirit. And whoso cometh unto me with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, him will I baptize with fire and with the Holy Ghost, even as the Lamanites, because of their faith in me at the time of their conversion, were baptized with fire and with the Holy Ghost, and they knew it not. Behold, I have come unto the world to bring redemption unto the world, to save the world from sin. Therefore, whoso repenteth and cometh unto me as a little child, him will I receive, for of such is the kingdom of God. Behold, for such I have laid down my life, and have taken it up again; therefore repent, and come unto me ye ends of the earth, and be saved.” Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ loves us no matter our faults they are with us and each week we are blessed to feel closer to them as we attend church and especially sacrament meeting.</p>
