            <p>All baked goods need some flour, water, yeast (active, natural, instant), eggs, oil, and salt; you would be amazed at what you can create with these items. Six years ago, my children and husband were going through so much bread, and we were tight on our funds so making multiply trips a week to the store was not acceptable. I remember my grandmother making bread and other baked good because it kept the grocery bill done and I was on a search to making more baked good while filling my family’s stomachs and just having a great feeling knowing what is going into my family’s food. At first, I think everyone feels a little scared trying something new but when you get the hang of it, you’ll never go back. It’s amazing to see what you can make with the simplest bread dough recipe that I don’t think some people think about and sometimes we get in on heads that bread dough is to make sandwich bread and that’s just not the case. With the same recipe you can turn your dough into cinnamon rolls, scones, rolls and you can make bread with added mix ins like cinnamon chips, cheddar cheese and so much more. I want to show you just how you can turn what you have in your kitchen into a yummy baked good without all the add fillers that you can find in store-bought baked goods.</p>
