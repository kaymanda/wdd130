    <h2>Amanda Smith</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Amanda and surprisingly I have never had a nickname. I am 36 years old and 
        have been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints my entire life. I have been married for 16 years. 
        I am a mom of three between the ages of 9 to 15. I have been a stay-at-home mom most of the time in the last 14 years. 
    <p> Last year I decided to final further my education by signing up for the BYU-Pathways. I only have my High School Diploma and always
        wanted to go to college and looking forward to learn more. I am still unsure what 
        exactly I want to do, I am thinking about something with computer/technology, but I am enjoying learning 
        new things especially learning different coding languages.</p>
    <p>Some things about me are I love to bake and cook for my family and others, I have been making homemade bread 
        for the last five year and now provide it to my ward for the sacrament. My family is really into playing 
        video games, watching people play video games like on Twitch and watching all kinds of anime together. 
        I enjoy reading books and all kinds of manga, also really enjoy watching Asian drama (Korean, Chinese and Japanese mainly).
        My husband and I love watching football, which makes us a little different because we are sports fans but also geek/nerds 
        and we are totally ok with that.</p>
