        Homemade bread is something you think of when you think of your grandma, at least that is what I thought when I was younger.  Why is that? I think with the convenience of stores and mass production of baked goods it has become the norm to just go to the store and buy bread and other baked goods. For me I remember every time I went to my grandparents home my grandma always had something homemade to eat and it was always the best thing I have eaten and even taught me how to make yummy baked goods, it is one of my favorite memories. I want to create a space where I can share what I have learned over the years and share as a mom why I switched for a lot of store-bought baked goods to learning and making them from home. I also would love to show you just how versatile bread dough and why more and more people are starting to bake more in their kitchen.

      <h3>Baked Goods</h3>
      <p>
        Baked goods with some flour, water, yeast (active, natural, instant), eggs, oil, and salt; you would be amazed at what you can create with these items. Six years ago, my children and husband were going through so much bread, and we were tight on our funds so making multiply trips a week to the store was not acceptable. I remember my grandmother making bread and other baked good because it kept the grocery bill done and I was on a search to making more baked good while filling my family’s stomachs and just having a great feeling knowing what is going into my family’s food. At first, I think everyone feels a little scared trying something new but when you get the hang of it, you’ll never go back. It’s amazing to see what you can make with the simplest bread dough recipe that I don’t think some people think about and sometimes we get in on heads that bread dough is to make sandwich bread and that’s just not the case. With the same recipe you can turn your dough into cinnamon rolls, scones, rolls and you can make bread with added mix ins like cinnamon chips, cheddar cheese and so much more. I want to show you just how you can turn what you have in your kitchen into a yummy baked good without all the add fillers that you can find in store-bought baked goods.

      <h3>Benefits</h3>
      <p>
        Benefits to making your our baked good from home. First you know what is going into your food and there really isn’t any extra things in it that you found in the store and mass production baked goods so in turn you know what is going into your body as well. Second, homemade just tastes better. In recent years it seems like farmers markets and people selling their homemade baked goods have been on the rise. Third, you tend to not get that bloating sick feeling after you eat something you’ve made over want you have eaten from a box store. Four, it’s more cost effective if buy the main ingredients for bread dough, i.e. flour, oil, yeast and even salt in bulk you can make multiply things. I for one go through a 25lb bag of flour every 1-2 months but with that I can provide my family with bread, sweets and much more. I want to share the benefits I have seen in my family and myself in the last six years of making homemade baked goods over always buying from the store. You may think it’s hard to do but trust me it is easier than you think, and you can even have your children help which is an added benefit because they are learning a new skill.
